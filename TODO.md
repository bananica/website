# TODO

- https://github.com/sledilnik/website/issues/680
    - absolutebubbles
        - reduce the size of bubbles (1 is one pixel)
        - do not axis-color bubbles on absolute bubbles  
            - and hide the color axis 
            

    - z=value / z=population
    - include municipalities (without coloring)

- countries charts ideas:
    - "include Slovenia" switch
    - range selector (first wave/second wave/all)
