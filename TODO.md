# TODO

- https://github.com/sledilnik/website/issues/770
    - for age groups, we cannot have pre-determined list of series, 
        they should be based on the actual data - only those with actual
        deceased should be present

- new OWID export
    - return back the official URL, once it has been pushed to production
    - remove properties from DataPoint that we don't use
    - adjust API query for each individual chart

- countries charts ideas:
    - "include Slovenia" switch
    - range selector (first wave/second wave/all)
