# TODO

- https://github.com/sledilnik/website/issues/606
    - how is doubling calculated?
        - see municipalities
    - show previous week, current, next 7, 14 days
    

## New countries chart
- deaths per cases (windowed, averaged)

## Age groups timeline - active cases
- tooltip should include sum + percentages of each group

## World page
- each countries chart should have its own sets of countries
- charts:
    - deaths per cases
        - show as percentages
        - add SI descriptions
    - current deaths per 1M

- can we reuse OWID data across charts?
    - locking
    - caching multiple country sets?
